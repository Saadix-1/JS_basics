Welcome to my collection of JavaScript projects focused on fundamental algorithms and data structures. This repository showcases various practical exercises and small applications I developed to strengthen my JavaScript skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Projects Overview

### Cash Register

A cash register application that calculates the correct change to return to a customer. It considers the purchase price, the cash given by the customer, and the available cash in the register drawer to provide an accurate breakdown of change.

### Pokémon JavaScript

An interactive project focused on handling and displaying Pokémon data using JavaScript. It involves working with APIs, DOM manipulation, and dynamic content rendering.

### Other Projects

Additional smaller projects and exercises are included in the repository, each targeting specific JavaScript concepts like array manipulation, loops, functions, and basic algorithms.
